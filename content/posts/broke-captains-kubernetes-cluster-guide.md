## The Intro

In this guide, I will be showing how to set up a simple Kubernetes(K3S) cluster which will have 1 master node and 2 worker nodes on Hetzner Cloud. My main goal is to make newcomers' transition to Kubernetes very smooth as a person who suffered enough with complex tutorials/bills and didn't get enough chance to poke a Kubernetes cluster.

This tutorial should be applicable to any cloud provider but be warned pricing would be extremely different. If you come to learn Kubernetes, this could be your starting point to set up your own cluster and get started poking around with an actual production-ready cluster with k3s.

## Quick QA

- What is K3S?

It is a production-ready, stable and lightweight flavor of Kubernetes, think it is like Debian being a flavor of Linux. It is also the best choice for learning multi-master and multi-worker node architecture.

- Why not teach us minikube/kind/microk8s?

They are not good enough for production workloads.

- Why Hetzner cloud?

It is super cheap and simple cloud UI for me, you can do the same things in Vultr, Linode, Digital Ocean. **Note: I am not sponsored by Hetzner Cloud**

- Do I need to install docker?

Not needed because k3s binaries ship with everything that is needed

- What is the difference between a master node and a worker node?

A master node is often referred to a K3S server and a worker node is often referred to a K3S agent. For high availability(HA), the recommendation is to have at least 3 master nodes, 3 worker nodes, and 1 managed database outside of your master node instead of having an embedded SQLite database.

## Setup your SSH key, network and compute instances

Before we create our compute instance(VPS), we will need SSH key setup, private network setup. Let's quickly go over it. Let's generate our ssh-key üóùÔ∏è

![ssh-keygen.png](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/hs2guk95i0z6bnir8z23.png)

Let's add our ssh-key to our local machine and public ssh-key to the cloud UI. This panel may be different depending on your cloud provider. üóùÔ∏è

![ssh-add.png](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/dsgu6qp4c200md6sk4j4.png)

![hetzner-ssh-tab.png](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/4u78hq4mserlga6rx4l0.png)

After that, let's quickly create our private network which will be used for our compute instances for the cluster's nodes communication between the master and the worker nodes. ‚òéÔ∏è

![hetzner-network-tab.png](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/8eeb5kdo1vns8fh8qlw5.png)

![nebula-network-created.png](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/azzu13gtv38khkghpnos.png)

We are finally ready to create our compute instances. Now I will create my master node which can also be called as k3s server. I will call my master node's name "jack-sparrow". I will pick "Debian 11" as my Linux distro choice for rock-solid server stability and being a reliable open source project.

I will also take advantage of multiple instance creation and set the instance count to 3. The other 2 instances will be my worker nodes which can also be called as k3s agents. I will call them "black-pearl" and "flying-dutchman". If you want to extend your worker nodes, you can keep going with all the ship names from Pirates of the Caribbean. For master nodes, I will be using captain names üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è

I have picked CX11 instance which is the cheapest option available. 6GB RAM and 60GB SSD should be sufficient enough for most of your projects. I skipped additional volume and the firewall. I added my created network and my created SSH key. Remember, this is for broke captains. üö¢

![created-compute-instances.png](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/1lmry6esapuqj1vo6iqp.png)

## Prerequisites for K3S

SSH into **the master node and the worker nodes.** Update /etc/hosts files before we get our great k3s binaries which has everything including containerd runtime and CNI(container network interface). üêã

```bash
$ ssh root@94.130.227.124

$ apt update && sudo apt upgrade

$ apt install apparmor apparmor-utils // Debian dependency for the Kernel
```

After you have updated **every nodes**' /etc/hosts file with GNU nano. Optionally you can install nmap CLI tool to make sure your network is functioning properly and other instances are connected through the web with `nmap -sn 10.0.0.1/24` üï∏Ô∏è

## Installation of K3S

In jack-sparrow instance(master node), let's install k3s server.

```bash
$ curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

$ systemctl status k3s.service
‚óè k3s.service - Lightweight Kubernetes
     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/k3s.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)

$ kubectl get nodes -o wide

```

Let's configure incoming/outgoing ports for jack-sparrow, our k3s server. Also obtain the token which will be used during k3s agents setup.

```bash
$ apt install ufw
$ ufw default allow outgoing
$ ufw default deny incoming
$ ufw allow 22,80,443,6443,10250/tcp
$ ufw --force enable
Firewall is active and enabled on system startup

$ cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token

```

Let's install k3s agents in our computing instances which are called black-pearl and flying-dutchman! Our master IP (jack-sparrow) is `10.0.0.4` in our nebula network. And our token is `bc3f7dee0308f09e5a3645f4b06343eea2644296cdK1d79a977d0e193a10187497f::server:9ae1e45b8b58be56a8282a84c7e3715b`

```bash
curl -sfL http://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://10.0.0.4:6443 K3S_TOKEN=bc3f7dee0308f09e5a3645f4b06343eea2644296cdK1d79a977d0e193a10187497f::server:9ae1e45b8b58be56a8282a84c7e3715b sh -

Perfect! Let's jump into Jack Sparrow! and see what we got!

```bash
root@jack-sparrow:~# kubectl get nodes -o wide

```

## Extras(Install LENS)

Lens is a Kubernetes UI for managing your cluster resources. It comes bundled with Helm and kubectl for your local workstation. You can install lens binary from the github under the name lensapp/lens. We will be taking the kube config from jack sparrow and pasting it into your Lens. To do that let's find our kube config and copy paste. And change the server IP address to external IP address of our jack sparrow instead of 127.0.0.1

```bash
root@jack-sparrow:~# cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
```

![lens-intro.png](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/h7158c41j7rfhfv4p5b7.png)

![kubeconfig-on-lens.png](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kaqo49fgn19ik3obiwqc.png)

![lens-nodes.png](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/kra7vdvo3aoh8st6a86s.png)

Let's create pirate-deployment.yaml, pirate-service.yaml and traefik-ingress.yaml to see generated lens metrics. And apply them in our cluster.

```yaml
# pirate-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pirate-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: pirate-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: pirate-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: simple-pirate
          image: mrwormhole/simple-pirate
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

```yaml
# pirate-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: pirate-svc
spec:
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  selector:
    app: pirate-app
```

```yaml
# traefik-ingress.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: pirate-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: traefik
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service: 
            name: pirate-svc
            port: 
              number: 80
```

```yaml
$ kubectl create -f pirate-deployment.yaml
$ kubectl create -f pirate-service.yaml
$ kubectl create -f traefik-ingress.yaml
$ kubectl get ingress
NAME             CLASS    HOSTS   ADDRESS                                       PORTS   AGE
pirate-ingress   <none>   *       116.203.32.141,116.203.90.71,94.130.227.124   80      136m
```

Now we can enable the lens metrics from pinned clusters and go to its settings and install all of the required things via lens metrics tab. We will need prometheus, kube state metrics and node exporter from lens metrics section.
