In this post, I announce my newest tool for language learners. As long as I am learning a new language, I plan to maintain it under my voluntary github org called [Lingua Sensei](https://github.com/lingua-sensei).

## What is Laverna? What does it solve?

Laverna is a sleek command-line tool that transforms text into spoken audio. All it needs is a config file to read. Whether you're practicing Thai greetings, perfecting your Japanese pronunciation, or working on English phrases, Laverna can boost your productivity when you want to store individual language audios.

## Getting Started

If you're a Go user, simply run `go install github.com/lingua-sensei/laverna@latest`
Not a Go developer? No problem! You can download ready-to-use binaries directly from [releases](https://github.com/lingua-sensei/laverna/releases/tag/v0.0.1-rc).

After you have installed, simply create a YAML file such as example.yaml

```yaml
- speed: normal
  voice: th
  text: "‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏™‡∏î‡∏µ‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö"
- speed: slower
  voice: en
  text: "Hello there"
- speed: slowest
  voice: ja
  text: "„Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ~"
```

then pass along the command line as below.

```
laverna -file example.yaml
```

if you fancy the flags, here they are;

```
Usage of laverna:
  -file string
        filename path that is used for reading YAML file
  -workers int
        maximum number of concurrent downloads (default 20)
```

Want to give Laverna a try this holiday season? Head over to [Laverna GitHub Repository](https://github.com/lingua-sensei/laverna) and you can start creating your personalized language learning audio. Happy Holidays and happy learning! üéÑüéß‚ú®
