WormholeRelays is the personal dev blog for myself only. I am also learning this as 
a foundation project stone to learn Hugo(SSG) more. Hugo can give opinionated structure
to work on different multiple websites in git CMS way. It also supports JS/TS and CSS/SCSS.

From my personal experience, some websites don't need SPA libraries like angular,react,vue,svelte.
They overcomplicate things and put many burdens on the future developer due to tons of dependencies.
